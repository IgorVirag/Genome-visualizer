# Genome-visualizer
This repository contains an application for manualy entering nucleobases and visualizing genome from generated nucleobases pars.

## Guide on application usage

### Starting the application
* To start the application you nead to open the Unix .EXE file with the name "Gene_visualization_app".
The EXE file can be faund in folder with the name "Gene_visualization_app"

### Nucleobases entry
* Upon opening the application, the terminal window will pop up.
The first thing you will notice is a query that asks you to input the nucleobase labels. The picture below shows the mentioned.

* You can enter nucleobases one by one or in a sequence. 
When you are satisfied with the entry and no longer wish to enter the nucleobases, type the letter "q" as "Quit" to activate the next stage of application.
The picture below shows an example of nucleobase entry in a sequence:

* When application recognizes the later "q" as "Quit", it will say that your Nucleboase entry is completed

### Wrong nucleobase entrys

* If you find yourself entering a letter that is not A,T,G or C the application will recognize the false entry, and in the case of a sequential entry, it will show the wrong letter and its place in the sequence.

* If your entry is again something different than A,T,G or C, the application will tell you that your entry is wrong again and show you the previously described text message.

### MUTATION

* After your nucleobase entry is completed, application will issue a query that asks if you want to do a single random mutation of a nucleobase.
* If you chose to initiate mutation, application will output a text message indicating that your mutation is done. After that application will show the results in a form of a genome.

* If you choose to not initiate mutation, application will show the results shown in the picture below:
